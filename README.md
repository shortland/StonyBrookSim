## About

A Simulator/RPG game made for the course CSE 380 - Computer Game Programming.

**The University Simulator team were invited finalists for Stony Brook University's 15th Annual Game Programming Competition.**

University Simulator was created with the Phaser 3 game engine, with all original artwork.

The game is meant to simulate the University life; with the player having to play various minigames and tasks in-order to keep their 'popularity', 'GPA', and other various stats at a good standing.

But at night, university students become zombies and spawn in large numbers around you!

## Last Thoughts

We had so much more planned for this game - we wanted to make it multiplayer, and have a fully functioning 'instagram' like knockoff in the game - meant for your social media following... 

We intendend to implement real homework and exam questions for classes that a player could register for using a knockoff of the Solar system Stony Brook uses for class registrations...

These were just some of the ideas we had but unfortunately we weren't able to implement them all in time. We're still very happy with how far we've brought this project in the limited amount of time we had and the new technologies we had to learn.
